INTRODUCTION                                            *alternate-introduction*

This plugin allows to quickly switch between alternate files. A common use
case for this plugin is to switch between C/C++ header and source files.

Vim-alternate works by specifying an alternate extension for a specific
extension, and then allows to switch to that file using a single command or
shortcut. The alternate file may be located in a different directory relative
to the current file. The directories that are considered can be configured.

This plugin is similar to the well-known a.vim, but simpler. vim-alternate
weighs in at less than sixty lines of pure Vim script, and that includes
whitespace and comments. Furthermore, it simplifies dealing with a cycle of
alternates. For example, with vim-alternate it is possible to switch from a
C++ source file (.cpp) to its corresponding header file (.h), from the header
file to the corresponding header source file (.hpp) and finally back again to
the C++ source file. Something a.vim does not handle correctly as far as I
know.

REQUIREMENTS                                            *alternate-requirements*

This plug-in has no additional requirements.

Note

This plug-in so far has only been tested with Neovim 0.3.2+, under Linux. I do
not have access to a Windows machine. Please consider Windows support to be
broken until proven otherwise. Pull requests are welcome!


USAGE                                                          *alternate-usage*

Vim-alternate provides one command that opens the alternate file for the file
loaded in the current buffer:

  :Alternate

No default keymappings are provided, but can easily be defined by the user.
For example, to map F4 to :Alternate, add the following lines to your Vim
configuration:

  nmap <silent> <F4> :Alternate<CR>

Vim-alternate will then search for an alternate file based on the current
configuration.

For more details and examples, see the OPTIONS section.


OPTIONS                                                      *alternate-options*

To set an option, include a line like the following in your Vim configuration:

    let g:AlternatePaths = ['../itf', '../src', '.', '..']

The following is a list of all available options:


                                                              *g:AlternatePaths*

    |g:AlternatePaths|                    comma separated list of alternate paths

        Comma separated list of paths relative to the current file that are
        searched for the alternate file.

        Default value is: ['.', '../itf', '../include', '../src']

                                                  *g:AlternateExtensionMappings*

    |g:AlternateExtensionMappings|       list of dictionary from string to string

        List of dictionaries mapping an extension to an alternate extension.

        Default value: [{'.cpp' : '.h', '.h' : '.hpp', '.hpp' : '.cpp'}, \
                        {'.c': '.h', '.h': '.c'}]
